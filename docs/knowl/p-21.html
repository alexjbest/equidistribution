<p>Why do exponential sums enter the picture? We are trying to prove that we have a sum converging to an integral. Generally we work with a basis of functions first, we could try using fourier analysis, using harmonics as our basis, this is when exponential sums appear. That requires us to work out harmonics on the sphere (spherical harmonics) which leads to representation theory, which as the sphere is compact involves Weyl representations etc.</p>
