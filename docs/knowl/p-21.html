<p>After this came Duke in 1988, in the mean time, Weil conjectures were proved, Iwaniec gave bounds for Kloosterman sums. Duke was a graduate student of Sarnak at Courant. He gave a more direct proof of <a knowl="./knowl/thm-linnik.html" title="Theorem 1.2: Linnik">1.2</a> which does not have the \(\legendre{N}{p} = 1\) condition. His proof is based on the theory of (half-integral weight) modular forms, and a good bound Iwaniec on certain exponential sums.</p>
